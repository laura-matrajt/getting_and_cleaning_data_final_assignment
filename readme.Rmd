This repository contains the files necessary to submit the final assignment of the Coursera course "Getting and cleaning Data".


## run_analysis.R script
This file contains the r script that will load the data sets, clean them and create the new tidy data set that this final assignment requires.

## codeBook.Rmd
This file contains a description of the data, the variables used, and the transformations done to them to obtain a 
"tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

## variables_used.txt
This file contains the names of the variables used in the tidy data frame, that is, only the measurements with a mean or standard deviation were. This file is here so that the codeBook.Rmd can read the file and generate the table of variables.
